# Chess Stat Tracker

This project uses the Chess.com public game data to process and display user stats beyond what Chess.com provides to free users.

The documentation for the Chess.com API is available [here](https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api)

The UI is built using [skeleton.dev](https://skeleton.dev/) and a custom theme found in the chessStatsTheme.ts file.

This project was my first time using Svelte and probably doesn't follow typical Svelte coding standards, but was a fun learning experience.
